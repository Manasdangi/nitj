 <p ><b><u>ABOUT </u></b><br>
The Institute is fully funded by Ministry of Education (Shiksha Mantralaya), Government of India. More than 12,000 students have alre
ady been graduated since its establishment. Extending into an area of over 317 acres of lush greenery, the campus of the Institute is
 imaginatively laid-out with a picturesque landscape.<br>
<br>

To create a centre for imparting technical education of international standards and conduct research at the cutting edge of technology
 to meet the current and future challenges of technological development.
<br>
<b><u>INFRASTRUCTURE</u></b><br>
The campus area has been organized in four functional sectors:<br>
i. Instructional Buildings<br>
ii. Central Facilities<br>
iii. Students Hostels<br>
iv. Staff Colony<br>
The instructional buildings include departments, Central Library and administrative block and are at a walking distance from the students
hostels and staff colony. The instructional buildings have been so located that these are fairly near to both the hostels and the staff
quarters and are at a walking distance from both. There is a branch of ICICI Bank Ltd. on the premises and a Post-office in the campus.
 A full-fledged dispensary is supervised by a team of Medical Officers and two Compounders. The Institute has also been extending facility

 zone and another near the hostels provide facilities to the students and the staff during and beyond the working hours of the Institute.
